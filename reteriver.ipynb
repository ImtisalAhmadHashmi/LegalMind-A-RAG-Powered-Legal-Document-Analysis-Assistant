INTRODUCTION \\n \\nIn congested and developed small cities, urban sprawl has become a serious i ssue, leading to severe traffic congestion. A \\nchallenging task to avoid congestion by the general public or the emergency services lies in determining the state of the traffic \\non the roads. Traffic congestion is one of the major problems of big cities, caused by the increasing number of people living. \\nTraffic congestion is caused when excess vehicles are on the road, causing traffic to slow down or even stop due to road \\ncapacity being exceeded. The economy, the environment, and people's quality of life are all impacted by traffic congestion.       \\n      An increasing amount of traffic data is produced daily due to the proliferation of vehicles, passengers, roadways, and \\nroute combinations. Optimal route planning, intelligent transportation system implementation, traffic management and \\nmonitoring system de sign, and many other applications can benefit from these traffic data. Researchers have gathered and \\nprocessed traffic data with varying technical features and operational variables using a variety of data collection \\nmethodologies. The utilization of  crowd-sourcing technologies based on Global Positioning System (GPS) has been \\nextensively employed in the collection of traffic data. In most cases, a management system will use real -time Google Maps \\nto assess routes depending on the current traffic condi tions. When it comes to emergency services, the selection of traffic \\nroutes becomes even more crucial. Several research projects have been conducted with the aim of reducing traffic congestion. \\nThese include integrated traffic management systems, route gui ding systems, intelligent transportation systems, intelligent \\ntransportation incidents management, navigation systems, traffic predictions, and traffic signal optimization [1].  \\n      These technologies harness the collective traffic information from the crowd through their internet -enabled devices in \\nreal-time, offering a promising alternative to the conventional methods of traffic data collection. Using crowdsourcing to \\ngather traffic data yields reasonably accurate travel time predictions, according to studies [2] Public planning that makes use\"),\n",

The pr imary problem in dynamic traffic management is efficiently utilizing all routes based on their limited \\nquantity and capacity. Typically, it is impractical to create new routes or expand road capabilities. Therefore, it is crucia l to \\nfind strategies to optimize the use of the current transportation infrastructure [3]. \\n      For this research, a crowded metropolis is used as a case study. Rising numbers of people living in cities and more people \\nowning cars are a few of the many causes. Improving infrastructure, bolstering public transportation, implementing efficient \\ntraffic management systems, and incorporating cutting-edge technology like AI are all necessary to address this problem and \\nmake cities more accessible. The goal, in case of road blockage, is to utilize machine learning to predict the likelihood of \\ntraffic on alternate routes. This will aid society as a whole by assisting traffic cops in better planning the route bottlenecks.  \\n      The novelty of our work lies in adopting cutting edge data driven models for congestion prediction and optimal route \\nsuggestion for smart cities in healthcare services. We employed ensemble Machine Learning (ML) models due to their \\nscalable, adaptable, and  data-driven decision-making behavior by using data from the past to make informed decisions for \\noptimal route selection for healthcare and rescue services. Optimizing traffic congestion through predictive route \\nidentification has many benefits such as economic benefits, environmental impact, emergency response time, and \\nempowering public planning leveraging AI to enhance overall traffic management and societal welfare.  \\n      In this work, both conventional AI algorithms and ML methods were employed to forecast traffic conditions and possible \\nalternate routes. ML models look for trends in historical data and, using that information as a foundation, these models \\nforecast future outcomes of various variable combinations and choose the best one. The objective was to provide the \\nhealthcare services, traffic police, and rescue services with more information to work with when making decisions and \\nplanning the road obstructions.  In this study, the dataset taken in the form of velocity, flowrate, density, and output \\nmeasurements were in real time. Accident and ambulance delay statistics are also part of our investigation to enhance the \\nquality of healthcare and rescue services. \\n \\n2. Literature Review \\n \\nOne of the most basic necessities in modern civilization is fast mobility. People can so utilize a variety of modes of \\ntransportation, including cars, subways, and bicycles. But despite all of these mobility options, cars continue to be the mos t \\npopular because of their usefulness and comfort [4] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), delays caused \\nby traffic congestion contribute to approximately 10 –15% of preventable deaths in emergency situations worldwide. \\nIn major metropolitan cities, the av erage ambulance response time has significantly increased due to rising traffic \\nvolumes; for instance, in New York City, emergency response times rose from 9.1 minutes in 2018 to 10.8 minutes in \\n2022 [4-5]. In developing cities, response times often exceed 15 minutes , surpassing the golden hour standard crucial for \\ntrauma and cardiac arrest cases. The Texas A&M Transportation Institute (TTI) reports that urban congestion alone \\ncauses nearly 3.2 billion hours of delay and 3 billion gallons of wasted fuel ann ually, illustrating the economic and \\nenvironmental impact of traffic inefficiencies [6].  This increased the number of vehicles on road and is major reason of traffic \\ncongestion and results in increasing number of traffic accidents, economic impact and environmental issues due to greenhouse \\ngasses emission [5,6]. \\n      There could be three main reasons of traffic congestion, that is, accidents, working zones, and bad weather. The traffic in \\nworking zone vary during the peak and off -peak times. The bad weather accounts for 40% of all traffic congestion, which \\nreflects the lack of infrastructure to deal with the blockage. Many other reasons contribute to traffic congestion in certain area \\nlike improper management of traffic signals, office times, special event etc. [7].  Collecting the real time accurate traffic data \\nto detect the blockage and congestion of traffic in certain area is major concern in research. Various technologies have been  \\nused to collect the data like traffic visualization system visible light sensors, wireless sensing systems and GPS data from \\ngoogle maps. \\n      The vehicles detection and localization tasks were performed by analyzing channel state information (CSI) [8], received \\nsignal strength indicator (RSSI) [9], link quality indicator (LQI), and packet loss rate [10]. Wireless transmission is utili zed \\nin a me thod to identify road traffic congestion, as suggested in reference [10]. Wireless transmitters and receivers are \\nnecessary for this technology. The transmitters send packets in a continual manner. The receivers, positioned across a road, \\nassess the RSSI, LQI, and packet loss measures. The measurements were demonstrated to accurately distinguish between \\nfree-flowing and congested traffic conditions. The method was executed and evaluated using ZigBee model. Another model \\nwith RSSI analysis used with 2 Wi-Fi access points and data was collected on laptop where Mean values and variance \\nindicates the empty roads, moving vehicles and blockage due to stoppage of vehicles [11]. Many other researchers also used \\nsame wireless route points to identify the traffic flow. \\n      Visible light sensors work well for tracking and identifying moving objects. Variations in infrared radiation have been \\nused in a wake-up system that permits sensor nodes to be placed into sleep mode until their activation is required. The sensor \\ndetects these variations in infrared radiation when a vehicle or person passes in the vicinity of the sensor. Near -infrared \\nsensors have been used to detect object shadows [12]. The purpose of the shadow detection technique was video detection.'),\n",

However, because infrared cameras are expensive, such applications are \\nnot taken into consideration in this work. Google Maps is a digital mapping service created by Google that is the leading \\nprovider of transportation information and advancements. Google Maps functions as a search tool for location-based services. \\nGoogle Maps uses GPS data from the Google Maps app on cellphones through crowdsourcing. Google Maps has access to \\nlocal municipality data throug h contracts, including road -specific information, road kinds, road maintenance, and speed \\nlimits. \\n      There are many existing approaches that address traffic congestion and optimizing road networks in urban areas. Traffic \\nsignal optimization is a traditional method that uses fixed schedules or predefined traffic patterns to adjust signal timings , \\naiming to minimize delay and maximize traffic flow. The traffic signals can be categorized in two categories fix time or traffic \\nresponsive system [14]. Many algorithms have been used to improve the traffic signals, Reinforcement learning approach is \\nmajor techniques used in multi agent system to improve the traffic signals [15,16] but the discrete nature of RL system was \\nmajor limitation which was improved by using function approximation methods [17]. The responsive traffic system uses \\npredictive models to pr edict the traffic flow at intersections and adjust the signal accordingly.  cooperative traffic signal \\ncontroller has been introduced based on Deep Reinforcement Learning and traffic flow prediction. The local policies learned \\nby traffic signal controller agents were transferred between the intersections [18]. \\nIntelligent transportation system incorporates technologies like traffic cameras, sensors, and communication system to \\nmonitor and manage traffic flow. Real -time information is provided to drivers through dynamic signs and speed limit \\nadjustments, enabling informed decisions. Pulse laser light is used to find the distance of vehicles (Sanchez, Saito et al. 2017). \\nVarious other techniques were used to in vehicle detection and localization are channel state information [8], received signal \\nstrength indicator [9,19], link quality indicator and pocket loss rate [10]. \\n      Traffic incident management is the effective management of incidents like accidents or road blockages is crucial to \\nminimize their impact on traffic flow [32]. Traffic incidents are unpredictable thus cannot be controlled by normal measures. \\nTraffic incidents occur randomly and lead to lane blockage, significantly decreasing the road's capacity. It can easily be \\nmanaged by improving the road infrastructure but results in high cost [20]. To overcome the estimated cost, the readily \\ndeveloped system can be improved by utilizing the intelligent transportation system technologies. Many countries have \\ndeveloped the traffic incident management system based on these technologies [21]. \\n      Many systems have been developed to improve the traffic flow during the emergency time, few of them are mentioned \\nabove. The key aspect of these systems is utilizing up -to-date information or data and interpreting the results to effectively \\nmanage and control the situation. Machine learning is now widely used to analyze the previous data and manage the traffic \\nsystem efficiently. Machine learning process a vast amount of data by dealing with higher dimensionality [23,25], requiring \\nmore efficient and quicker data processing that traditional approaches are unable to manage [22]. Machine Learning tools \\ngather large amounts of data by observing and interacting with users [31]. The data is processed through machine learning to \\noffer real-time traffic information and forecast future events and traffic conditions [29]. Machine learning models can be \\ntrained using datasets containing details such as event type, time of day, weathe r conditions, traffic volume, and incident \\nduration [33]. For this purpose, many algorithms are used like K-nearest neighbor [28], decision trees, a supervised learning \\nsystem utilized for data classification or prediction by splitting the data into smaller groups (Kim and Chang 2012), annual \\nneural network, used to predict the relatio nship between variables (Wang, Chen et al. 2005), random forest, an ensemble \\nlearning algorithm that aggregates predictions from several decision trees [24]. Bayesian networks [23], a hybrid of statistical \\nand machine learning model, are graphical represen tations that illustrate the probabilistic connections among variables. \\nBayesian networks can forecast the duration of a traffic incident by analyzing the interconnections among incident type, time \\nof day, meteorological conditions, traffic volume, and incident duration [26,27]. \\n \\nFilling the Research Gaps in Previous Studies: \\n \\nExisting traffic management systems, such as those employing real -time data from sensors, cameras, and GPS devices [A], \\noffer significant improvements in monitoring traffic conditions, but they lack predictive capabilities for road blockages and  \\ncongestion on alternative routes. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) [B] and dynamic route guidance [C] focus on \\noptimizing traffic flow and guiding drivers, yet they do not incorporate machine learning models for dynamic congestion \\nprediction after unexpected  road blockages. Incident management systems [D] provide real -time detection of incidents but \\ndo not predict traffic conditions in advance. Predictive analytics [E] models utilize historical traffic data to predict congestion, \\nyet they often lack the flexibility to account for unforeseen disruptions. Public information systems [F] offer real-time updates \\nbut fail to offer proactive route optimization post -blockage. Our study leverages machine learning models to predict \\ncongestion on alternative routes after blockages, providing real -time insights that improve traffic flow and emer gency \\nresponse times, especially for ambulances. This predictive ability, coupled with route optimization strategies, addresses the  \\ngaps in previous systems by proactively forecasting congestion and facilitating better decision-making for traffic authorities. \\nMoreover, our framework incorporates real -time data integration and the ability to dynamically adjust routes, improving \\ntraffic management in a way that previous systems, which rely solely on historical data or reactive approaches, could not \\nachieve.\"),\n",

Methodology \\n \\nThe overall methodology of the research is illustrated in Figure 1. The workflow chart depicts all the crucial steps taken \\nduring the end-to-end product development. In our work, system development started from system identification.  \\n \\nConceptual Model Development \\n \\nThe next step was the development of the conceptual model, where a rough sketch of the project was made, and specific goals \\nwere defined. To achieve these goals, real -time traffic data was collected from Trans-Peshawar (a government institute) in \\nPeshawar, Pakistan, and the latitude, and longitude of the selected points in the system and the distances between them were \\ncollected from Google Maps,  followed by data processing techniques. AI models were trained and optimized based on the \\navailable dataset to obtain improved results. Throughout these steps, Python libraries were used for data visualization and to \\nanalyze alternative path selection mechanisms. Once validated, the system was deployed by integrating all components into \\na user-friendly interface to enhance accessibility and effectiveness. \\n \\n3.1 Data Collection & Processing \\n \\nData on the death due to late arrival at the hospital was collected from “Provisional Monitoring Cell, Emergency Rescue \\nServices, Government Of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan”. T hen to train a machine learning model for forecasting traffic \\ncongestion, three variables were needed Density, Flowrate, and Velocity with output in binary format. Except for Density \\nother variables were collected from Trans-Peshawar in Peshawar, Pakistan. Density was derived using a Macroscopic Traffic \\nflow model.  \\nThe key feature variables used for machine learning model training include:  \\n• Velocity (Speed of vehicles in km/h) \\n• Flow rate (Total vehicles passing through a specific location per hour) \\n• Density (Number of vehicles per kilometer) \\n      Apart from these variables, real -time traffic congestion statistics were also gathered from Google Maps.

The flow rate and velocity data were directly collected during the data collection phase as these are fundamental  \\nindicators of traffic conditions. However, traffic density was not directly available in the data; therefore, it was derived using \\na macroscopic traffic flow model equation, which is a well-established method in traffic flow theory. The macroscopic model \\nlinks density, velocity, and flow rate, ensuring that the density data accurately reflects the traffic state. These features were \\nchosen because velocity and flow rate provide direct measures of traffic movement, while density offers insight into the \\nvehicle occupancy of a given road segment, a critical factor in congestion analysis. By incorporating these three features, we \\nensured that the model captures a comprehensive view of traffic conditions, enhancing its predictive capability for congestion \\nforecasting. The use of the macroscopic model to calculate density strengthened the overall model by allowing us to utilize \\nall key traffic features for more accurate predictions \\n \\nSampling: \\n \\nThe area was pre-determined, and clustering was applied to the traffic data collected within this specific zone. The data points \\nwere clustered based on varying traffic conditions such as vehicle density, vehicle average velocity, and traffic volume, which \\nprovided a comprehensive understanding of congestion levels. The boundaries between smooth flow and congestion were \\nestablished using these traffic-related thresholds, allowing for clear classification and differentiation between  various traffic \\nstates. This approach ensured that the analysis accurately represented traffic conditions across the zone while maintaining \\nconsistency in identifying congestion and smooth flow, thus addressing the reviewer's concern by offering a transparent and \\nmethodologically sound approach. \\n \\n3.2 Data Processing \\n \\nBefore model training, the collected data was subjected to preprocessing techniques to enhance model learning and accuracy. \\nThe following steps were taken to prepare the data for Machine Learning Model: \\n• Handling Missing Values: Any missing data points were imputed using mean value substitution.  \\nHandling Duplicate Values: All the duplicate values were dropped using the Numpy (Python Library) method.  \\nHandling Outliers: First, a boxplot was used to identify the outliers we found the 1 st and the 3rd quantile of each feature data \\npoint then any point below the 1 st quantile was changed to the 1 st quantile value, and any point above the 3rd quantile was \\nchanged to the 3rd quantile value. \\n• Normalization & Feature Scaling: Min-Max scaling was applied to normalize all numerical attributes. \\nInput and Output Dataset: The output and the Input Features were separated \\nTrain and Test Set: The Data was then divided into test and train datasets.  \\n \\n3.3 Model Development \\n \\nThe primary goal of this research was to develop a machine learning -based congestion prediction system, coupled with \\noptimal route selection using AI algorithms. Several classical ML models were evaluated for their su itability in traffic \\nprediction. The ML models used in our research work are listed below. \\n1. Random Forest Classifier: Random Forest Classifier is an ensemble learning system that combines different decision trees \\nfor predictions. It uses techniques like bagging and random feature selection to create diverse decision trees. Majority voting \\nis employed to make the final prediction, making it robust for high-dimensional data.  \\n2. AdaBoost Classifier: Ada Boost Classifier is an ensemble learning technique that iteratively modifies weight and combines \\npredictions from weak classifiers to create a strong classifier.

Gradient Boosting Classifier : Gradient Grading Boosting Classifier is also another type of boosting classifiers which  \\nsequentially constructs decision trees to reduce errors and make precise predictions. It starts with a simple weak learner an d \\ncomputes residuals between actual and predicted values. Weak learners are trained sequentially to minimize residuals and \\npredictions are updated iteratively.  \\n4. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier: Multilayer perceptron is a class of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model used \\nfor non-linear classification. This model is solely based on weighted average sum of the inputs which gradually proceeds to \\nthe output for binary or multiclass classification. It involves  initializing weights, feedforward propagation, loss calculation, \\nbackpropagation, and iterative training mechanisms. Mathematically it can be written as:\"),\n",

It \\nrecursively divides data based on feature thresholds to create decision nodes.

A-Star Algorithm (A*): A-star is a path-finding algorithm used to find the shortest path between two points on a graph or \\ngrid.

Hyperparameters for each model \\nwere fine -tuned based on prior literature and experimentation, optimizing factors such as the number of estimators and \\nlearning rate for AdaBoost and maximum depth for Random Forest. To ensure model generalization and mitigate overfitting, \\n10-fold cross-validation with stratified sampling was used, ensuring that the proportions of classes remained consistent across \\nall folds. This method provi ded a robust estimate of model performance while maintaining the integrity of the imbalanced \\ndataset \\n \\n3.4 Model Evaluation Metrics \\n \\nTo assess the performance of the proposed congestion prediction framework, three key evaluation metrics were utilized: \\n1. F1 Score: Provides a balanced measure of Precision and Recall, critical in congestion classification tasks.  \\n2. Accuracy: Measures the ratio of correctly predicted congestion cases to total test cases.  \\n3. AUC -ROC (Area Under the Curve - Receiver Operating Characteristic): Evaluates how well the model distinguishes \\nbetween traffic congestion and smooth flow. \\n      As our problem was of classification all the used evaluation matrices were of classification. Accuracy was used to check \\nthe general effectiveness of the model but accuracy alone can be misleading for an imbalanced dataset as out data was \\nimbalanced data set so an F1 Score was used which helped us to be sure that our model was performing accurately as it gave \\nequal importance to false negative and false positive. To above two evaluation matrices were also combined with AUC-ROC \\nas it evaluated how well the model is separating the 0 and 1 cases across different thresholds. \\nThe overall methodology of the research is illustrated in the form of Figure 1. The work flowchart depicts all the crucial \\nsteps taken during the End -to-End product development.

To achieve the goals, we collected a real time data from google maps and employed data processing techniques. \\nAI models were tra ined to best fit the data and then optimized with respect to the available data to obtain improved results. \\nDuring all these steps, we used open-source data visualization tools to observe the selection mechanism for alternate paths. To \\ndeploy the validated system, we integrated all components and user -friendly interface was created to utilize the effectiveness \\nof our developed model. \\n \\n3.1 Overview of the Machine Learning Models \\n \\nIn this work, the employment of ML for the optimal route selection is one the prime objectives.

It is an ensemble \\nlearning system that combines different decision trees for predictions. It uses techniques like bagging and random feature \\nselection to create diverse decision trees. Majority voting is employed to make the final prediction, making it robust for high -\\ndimensional data. Ada Boost Classifier is another ensemble learning technique that iteratively modifies weight and combines \\npredictions from weak classifiers to create a strong classifier. Weak learners are trained, and their performance is evaluated \\nand used to update data weight. This process continues iteratively, and a weighted majority vote is used for the final prediction. \\nGradient Boosting is used as a classifier in our work. It sequentially constructs decision trees to reduce errors and make \\nprecise predictions. It starts with a simple weak learner and computes residuals between actual and predicted values. Weak \\nlearners are trained sequentially to minimize residuals and predictions are updated iteratively. With the recent advancements \\nin deep learning, we were motivated to employ Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in our work. Multilayer perceptron is an \\nANN model used for classification purposes. It involves data preparation, weights initialization, feedforward propagation, loss \\ncalculation, backpropagation, and iterative training. It can predict class probabilities and make class predictions based on \\nneural network architecture.  \\nLogistic regression is a statistical model for binary classification, estimating probabilities of binary outcomes. It uses the \\nsigmoid function to convert a linear combination of input variables into probabilities. Model parameters are estimated to \\nminimize the error between predicted and actual values. The use of Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is encouraged due to its \\nperformance in many classicization tasks. SVC is a supervised learning model for classification that finds a hyperplane to \\nseparate data points into different classes. It introduces a slack variable to handle misclassification and includes a regularization \\nparameter. The objective is to find the best hyperplane while minimizing misclassification.  \\nAs a part of a linear classifier, we used a Ridge Classifier. It uses ridge regression to address multicollinearity in data and \\nadds a penalty term to the loss function to control model complexity. The trade -off between fitting the data and minimizing \\nweights is governed by the regularization parameter (alpha). As part of a Random Forest, the utilization of Decision Tree is \\nalso used as a separate tree -based classifier. It classifies data points based on feature attributes using a tree -like structure and \\nrecursively divides data based on feature thresholds to create decision nodes. The tree structure and decision rules are learne d \\nduring training to achieve accurate classification. Apart from the conventional ML algorithms, A -star is a pathfinding \\nalgorithm used to find the shortest path between two points on a graph or grid. It combines breadth -first and best-first search, \\nusing a heuristic function to guide the search. Nodes are prioritized based on the cost function, and the algorithm iterative ly \\nexplores and updates the path until reaching the goals. \\n \\n3.2 Performance Evaluation Metrics \\n \\nIn this work, the performance evaluation of the proposed framework has been carried out by employing the subjective quality \\nmeasures. The obtained metrics are based on the F1 score, Precision, Recall, and AUC -ROC score [29]. The F1 score is a \\nwidely used metric for evaluating the performance of many models. It is a useful measure for evaluating ML models in binary \\nclassification tasks. The model achieves a compromise between precision and recall, making it well -suited for imbalanced \\ndatasets. A higher F1 sc ore indicates superior performance, with a maximum value of 1 and a minimum of 0. It is beneficial \\nwhen false positives and false negatives have similar costs or when the class distribution is imbalanced. Mathematically, it can \\nbe written as: \\n𝐹1 = 2((𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 ∗  𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙) ⁄ (𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 +  𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙) ))                                                                   (1) \\nWhere: \\nPrecision = True Positive / (True Positive + False Positive) \\nRecall = True Positive / (True Positive + False Negative) \\n      Similarly, accuracy measures the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total number of instances in the dataset. It \\nhelps in providing the overall assessment in model correctness. It is calculated as:  \\n𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦 = (𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 ) ⁄ (𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠)     (2) \\n   Another very important measure in data driven tasks is the AUC -ROC (Area under the receiver operating characteristic \\ncurve), represents the area under the curve of the true positive rate (sensitivity) against false positive rate (1 -specificity) at \\nvarious thresholds. It evaluates the model's capacity to differentiate between classes. Considering class imbalance and \\nevaluating the model at several thresholds might provide a single number that shows the model's discriminatory ability. It can \\nbe calculated by using the following equation: \\n𝐴𝑈𝐶 − 𝑅𝑂𝐶 =  ∑ 1\\n2 (𝐹𝑃𝑅𝑖+1 − 𝐹𝑃𝑅𝑖)(𝑇𝑃𝑅𝑖 + 𝑇𝑃𝑅𝑖+1)                     (3) \\n \\nWhere: \\nFPR stands for “False Positive Rate” and TPR for “True Positive Rate”  \\n \\n4.

The training feature variables considered for ML model training for forecasting traffic congestion are density, \\nflow rate, and velocity which are labelled with binary outputs. All other variables except density were collected from Trans -\\nPeshawar (a government institute) in Peshawar, Pakistan. The corresponding values for density were manually calculated by \\nusing a Macroscopic Traffic flow model given as: \\nFlowrate =  Velocity ∗  Density (4)  \\n      Then “Cluster Random Sampling Technique” was used to sample the data or the ML model. Data was collected considering \\nthe Macroscopic Traffic flow model. Data collection and Data analysis took almost 45% time of the one-and-a-half-year-long \\nproject. The only limitation of this data set is that the world is evolving so to utilize this in the current time it would be better \\nto get the prediction on the recent data as the data collected was concerning the year this project was implemented.  Apart from \\nthe desir ed training variables, we required map data for implementing an alternative path algorithm. This data includes \\ninformation about nodes, connections between nodes and the distance between them. Also, coordinate data is needed for \\nvisualizing a selected zone alternative path, which includes information about nodes and their respective latitude and longitude \\ncoordinates. Therefore, we have selected over 22 different nodes and employed Google maps API to obtain coordinate data \\nfor different zones. Coordinate data shows the latitude and longitude of the zone and the selected nodes. Also, the alternative \\npath was discovered using the A-star algorithm, which needs location data to provide us the alternative path. All data including \\nnodes location, interconnection among all nodes, and their distances is also collected from the Google Maps API.  \\n      In our work, the experimented dataset has two feature variables, which are ‘Velocity’ and ‘Flowrate’, while the outcomes \\nare labelled in a binary format (0: Flow, 1: Traffic congestion). As explained in previous sections, ‘Density’ is also calculated \\nfrom the macroscopic traffic flow model and used as a feature variable [30]. \\n      A macroscopic traffic flow model is employed to describe and analyze traffic behavior at an aggregate level, focusing on \\nvariables like traffic density, flow rate, and velocity. These models help understand traffic patterns, predict congestion, a nd \\nmake decisions related to transportation policies and infrastructure changes. \\nThe employed model used three key input variables.  \\n• Velocity: The speed of vehicles measured in kilometers per hour (km/h).  \\n• Density: The number of vehicles per kilometer (v/km). \\n• Flowrate: The total number of vehicles passing through a specific location in vehicles per hour (v/h)  \\nThe model generates a binary output where “1” indicates traffic congestion jam situation and “0” represents smooth \\ntraffic flow. \\n      For the training of the ML model, a sampling technique is used which is called Cluster Random Sampling Technique. To \\nsupport the problem statement, the number of deaths due to the late arrival at the hospitals was needed. The data was collected \\nfrom the local provisional monitoring cell emergency rescue services. As per the available data, the number of deaths due to \\nlate arrival at the hospital were 709 and the total number of deaths in the area over a year from 2022 to 2023 is 3300. This \\ninformation is added as feature to compare the performance of the baseline and propose methods. \\n \\n 4.2 System Modelling  \\n \\nIn this study addressing traffic congestion, the crucial task is identifying congestion -prone zones within the traffic network, \\nparticularly focusing on critical locations such as areas around hospitals. The indicated zones are categorized based on the \\nfollowing factors such as geography, traffic flow patterns, and route connections. In this work, three main hospitals of the city \\nwere indicated as key points of interest and labelled as shown in Table 1.  \\n                                            Table 1: Locations Labelling \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe zone from location a to Pint 1 is labelled as “Route 1” due to its frequent congestion. This zone identification process \\nis pivotal for accurate congestion prediction and effective traffic management. Also, it will aid authorities in making informed \\ndecisions regarding road blockages, route selection, and overall traffic management strategies. Traffic congestion data was \\ncollected using Google Maps by taking screenshots throughout the day at 15 -minute intervals. The analysis revealed that the \\narea around Point 2 faced congestion most of the time leading to the selection of “Route 1”.

Experiments & Results \\n5.1 Data Analysis, Preprocessing, & Visualization \\n \\nIn our work, vital features of the training data are extracted to improve the statistical learning of the employed models. \\nTherefore, more features are added to enhance the learning capability of the employed models. As mentioned in previous \\nsections, the “density” feature was not present in the collected dataset, so we used macroscopic model equation to calculate its \\nvalue with reference to other values. Moreover, other features are scaled to have the coherent and uniform normalization \\nfactors. \\nThe statistical analysis of traffic patterns offers a systematic and quantitative method for comprehending, summarizing, \\nand modeling traffic data, including aspects of traffic flow and congestion. Through the application of various statistical \\ntechniques such as descriptive statistics, correlation analysis etc., it becomes possible to extract valuable insight, detect \\nimportant patterns, and conclude decisions aimed at enhancing traffic management strategies and the overall transportation \\nsystem.

The usability of F1 Score is emphasized as it balances \\nprecision and recall, making it more suitable than accuracy alone for classification tasks where false negatives and false \\npositives have significant consequences . Additionally, we employed AUC -ROC, which evaluates the trade -off between true \\npositive rate and false positive rate, providing a comprehensive measure of model performance in distinguishing congested \\nand non-congested traffic conditions. Although accuracy is a commonly used metric, it was included primarily for reference, \\nas high accuracy in imbalanced datasets can be  misleading if not complemented by more robust measures like F1 Score and \\nAUC-ROC.

It represents the area under the curve of the \\nreceiver operating characteristic plot. ROC is a graphical representation showing the trade -off between sensitivity and \\nspecificity at various thresholds. In evaluating the overall performance (Figure 9), it was found that the Ada Boost classifier \\nworks best for this study’s problem. It is also found that in Ada Boost classifier there is less chance of over -fitting, and it \\nhandles imbalance data set better than other models. In this study, the dataset is composed of more negative class samples, so \\nthe iterative approach in boosting misclassified samples was helpful in learning form the minority class. As we observed, its  \\nefficacy in building a st rong classifier by combining weak learners sequentially where each weak learner learns from its \\nprevious mistakes and creates a diverse ensemble that might generalize well to unseen data and hence work well for our \\nproblem set. AdaBoost prioritizes challenging instances by assigning greater weight to misclassified samples in each iteration, \\nmaking it the most optimal model for addressing the problem in this study.  \\n \\n0.99614\\n0.99871\\n0.99742\\n0.98523\\n0.9705\\n0.84958\\n0.95767\\n0.98742\\n0.75 0.8 0.85 0.9 0.95 1 1.05\\nRandom Forest\\nAda Boost\\nGradient Boosting\\nML Preceptron\\nLogistic Regressor\\nSV Classifier\\nRidge Classifier\\nDecision Tree\\nAccuracy Score\\nClassification Models\\nModel Comparison\\nFigure 7.

Determining Alternative Path  \\n \\nAs iterated in the problem statement, our work not only determined the congestion but an alternate path is also determined to  \\nfully equip the functionality of the proposed framework. In this work, we used A -star (A*) algorithm, which is a popular \\npathfinding algorithm. Its efficiency in cost ( g) and estimated goal cost ( h) balancing was the motive behind its application. \\nDue to its efficiency for large networks, it ensures the best route with consistent, non -overestimating heuristic (h).  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAfter our system has encountered the road blockage prediction at certain node, the A-star algorithm successfully generates \\nthe alternative path which is plotted using Folium. In Figure 11a, the red spot shows the block placed by the user, the visib le \\nnodes show the alternative path nodes out of the selected path, and the green joining the nodes shows the alternative path. \\nAlso, in Figure 11b, no block is placed so it shows the shortest path between two nodes without the blocking of the node.  \\n \\n5.8. Application Deployment \\n \\nIn last step, the developed system has been deployed as a full -fledge application by using the Streamlit . In the application \\ninterface, a user has the following options: \\n• “Starting node”, “Destination node”, and “Blocking node” (where he wants to put the block) as the inputs.  \\n• The user has four different options in the drop-down menu “See Selected path” where the user can visualize the selected \\nzone (Figure 12). \\n• “Blocking Node Map” where the user visualizes the selected nodes and can decide which node to block.  \\n• “Visualize The Alternative Path” where the user can visualize the alternative path after the block is placed (Figure 13).  \\n• “Generate Congestion prediction” where the user can visualize the predictions on the alternative path the block is placed. \\nHere user can select for which segment of the alternative path he wants the congestion predictions from another drop -down \\noption. \\nThe predictions are displayed in four different colors red (75%-100% congestion chances), Orange (50%-74% congestion \\nchances), Yellow (25%-49% congestion chances), and green (0%-24% congestion chances). \\n \\n (a) (b) \\nFigure 11.

The proposed framework employs \\nmachine learning algorithms for t he prediction of congestion specifically Ada Boost Classifier, the developed tool achieved \\n99.86% F1 Score, 99.87% Accuracy score, and 99.74% AUC -ROC score in predicting traffic congestion. The use of the A -\\nStar algorithm for alternative pa th selection further ensures optimal routes are identified, enhancing overall traffic \\nmanagement. Apart from the analytical results, a web -based interface has been developed which offers a user -friendly \\nexperience for traffic police, healthcare officials, and rescue officers to enable them make informed decisions about road \\nblockages and anticipate congestion on alternative routes. This study not only contributes to traffic management strategies but \\nalso considers public welfare by addressing the impact on emergency services, as evidenced by the inclusion of ambulance \\ndelay and casualties’ data. The significance of the project extends beyond the immediate problem, offering a potential solution \\nto mitigate the economic, environmental, and societal impact of t raffic congestion. Furthermore, the project showcases the \\nversatility of machine learning in real-world applications and provides a scalable solution that can be applied to other congested \\nurban areas. For future work, there is potential to enhance the too l's accuracy and usability by incorporating real -time data \\nfrom various sources, such as GPS and traffic cameras. Additionally, collaboration with local authorities and emergency \\nservices can lead to a more holistic approach in refining the tool's predictions and ensuring its effective implementation in real-\\nworld scenarios. Overall, the developed tool represents a significant step towards proactive traffic management, with the \\npotential for widespread applicability and continuous improvements through ongoi ng research and collaboration with \\nstakeholders. \\n \\nLimitations \\n \\nThis study presents a robust AI -based framework for congestion prediction and emergency route optimization, yet several \\nlimitations persist. The model’s reliance on historical traffic data makes it sensitive to inconsistencies, while limited real-time \\nsensor integration restricts adaptability to sudden road blockages. Scalability remains a challenge, as expanding the model to \\nlarger cities requires significant computational resources and retraining. Its ability to generalize in evolving traffic cond itions \\nis uncertain, particularly in dynamically changing urban environments. The assumption of static traffic regulations overlooks \\nreal-world scenarios like emergency lane clearances and temporary closures. Computational overhead from ensemble ML \\nmodels and the A-star algorithm may introduce latency in real -time applications. Additionally, the absence of user feedback \\nlimits dynamic route adjustments, and privacy constraints restrict access to critical real -time traffic and emergency response \\ndata. Future improve ments should focus on integrating real -time IoT data, adaptive learning, scalable AI solutions, and \\nenhanced collaborations with traffic management agencies for a more responsive and efficient system.  \\n \\nCode: https://github.com/ImtisalAhmadHashmi/THE-DEVELOPMENT-OF-AI-BASED-OPTIMAL-ROUTE-\\nSELECTION-FRAMEWORK-FOR-RESCUE-SERVICES-PROCESS-MANAGEMENT  \\n \\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Fahad M.

INTRODUCTION \\n \\nIn congested and developed small cities, urban sprawl has become a serious i ssue, leading to severe traffic congestion. A \\nchallenging task to avoid congestion by the general public or the emergency services lies in determining the state of the traffic \\non the roads. Traffic congestion is one of the major problems of big cities, caused by the increasing number of people living. \\nTraffic congestion is caused when excess vehicles are on the road, causing traffic to slow down or even stop due to road \\ncapacity being exceeded. The economy, the environment, and people's quality of life are all impacted by traffic congestion.\"),\n",

The economy, the environment, and people's quality of life are all impacted by traffic congestion.       \\n      An increasing amount of traffic data is produced daily due to the proliferation of vehicles, passengers, roadways, and \\nroute combinations. Optimal route planning, intelligent transportation system implementation, traffic management and \\nmonitoring system de sign, and many other applications can benefit from these traffic data. Researchers have gathered and \\nprocessed traffic data with varying technical features and operational variables using a variety of data collection \\nmethodologies. The utilization of  crowd-sourcing technologies based on Global Positioning System (GPS) has been \\nextensively employed in the collection of traffic data.
